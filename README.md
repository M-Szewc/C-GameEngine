# C-GameEngine
Serious attempt at creating a game angine temporary name - "GearzEngine"

# Setup
Project right now requires VulkanSDK and Clang. To change compilers, building scripts and vscode settings need to be changed (debuging stuff defined in engine/src/defines.h too).

Inside .vscode/c_cpp_properties.json:
- set compilerPath.
- check your windows sdk version
